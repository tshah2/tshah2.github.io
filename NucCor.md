Analysis of Molten Salt Corrosion on Various Alloys for Nuclear Application

Due to the increasing demand for energy and coupled with the concern for climate change, an effort is underway in order to determine a technologically feasible and energy effeicent alternative to the current fossil fuels. Conventional nuclear reactors utilize uranium as the primary nuclear product for fission reactions as well as water as the heat transfer fluid. This causes the reactors to be dangerous in high tempretures and cause large amounts of toxic waste. New Generation IV reactors utilizes thorium as the radioactive material and molten salts as the heat transfer fluid. The use of thorium's decay cycle allows for use of more radioactive material in energy generation and less toxic waste. Molten salts are able to retain high and do not create pressure the way traditional heat transfer fluids such as water and gas would. However, molten salts are highly corrosive and therefore research must be done in order to find compatable storage material for the salts.
