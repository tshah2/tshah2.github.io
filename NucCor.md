Analysis of Molten Salt Corrosion on Various Alloys for Nuclear Application

Due to the increasing demand for energy and coupled with the concern for climate change, an effort is underway in order to determine a technologically feasible and energy effeicent alternative to the current fossil fuels. Conventional nuclear reactors utilize uranium as the primary nuclear product for fission reactions as well as water as the heat transfer fluid. This causes the reactors to be dangerous in high tempretures and cause large amounts of toxic waste.
