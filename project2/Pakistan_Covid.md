**Spatial Analysis of Covid-19 in Pakistan**

This project looks looks into various factors in relation to the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Pakistan. The first two cases were confirmed on March 26th, 2020 in Karachi, Sindh. These cases were individuals which had recently traveled abroad to virus hit counteries and had returned to Pakistan. An anlysis of the spread of the virus in each proviance was conducted via a gif. An analysis of hospitals in each district was conducted and related to the cases of covid-19 in each district. A final analysis was conducted of education level and covid-19 cases per district. 


*Spread of Covid-19 in Proviances*

An analysis of the spread of Covid-19 was conducted in QGIS with GRASS  using the Time Manager plugin to generate a gif of the increase in the cases over a time period starting March 10,2020 to April 19,2020. From this map it can be seen that the most acceleration in cases can be seen in Punjab (the pink) then Sind (green) and then Khyber (yellow). An IDW was conducted of the population density which showed that the higher population density is in the north east of pakistan (the Gilgil region) however, it can be seen that Gilgil had one of the lowest cases and spread of Covid-19. High populations can be seen in Sind which matches which the spread and intensity of the spread in that proviance. The lowest population can be seen in the south and south west (Baluchistan) which also showed one of the least cases and spread of the virus.

This map was generated by data from the National Government of Pakistan's Official Covid-19 website which tracks daily cases and spread of the virus through the proviances and districts. The data was downloaded per proviance in cvs formate before being manually entered into a combined cvs to be used in QGIS's Time Series. Some of the data was missing for the cases in sindh which account for the gap in the time series.  An IDW was conducted on the population of th proviances to show population density across the proviances. 


*Hospitals related to Covid-19 Cases per District*

An analysis was conducted of the hospitals relative to covid-19 cases per district. The highest cases of Covid-10 per district can be seen in the north as well as in the east (Punjab) with cases in the south (Sindh). An IDW was conducted from the location of various hospitals in the area showing the highest concentration of hospitals in Punjab and some across the south, and west. From this map it can be seen that there is a concentration of hospitals in an area which is fartehr from the covid-19 cases.

This map was created from finding the latitude and longitude of hospitals in each district on google maps and manually generating a csv file to be uploaded into QGIS. There may be missing hospitals and districts due to the data being collected manually such as in proviances such as Baluchistan (the south west). The case data was downloaded in a csv which contained the % cases in each district from the National Covid-19 website. This data was combined manurally to the population data csv and multipled (percent cases times population) to find the amount of cases per district. An IDW was conducted to show the distribution of hospitals over the country. 

A farther analysis was conducted to determine the distance from the center of districts to the closest hospitals over a base map of the cases per district. From this it was seen that many of the districts in the mid-north had shorter distances compared to the districts in the south and north. Many of the highest infected districts has only a few hospitals in close proximity.

The hospital data and population data was collected as described above. The data was brought into QGIS and the distance tool was used to analyze the distance between the centers of the districts and the hospitals. 


*Analysis of Education Levels related to Covid-19 Cases per District*

An analysis was conducted to see if there was a relation between the education level of a district and the number of cases. No pattern was seen as many of the highest covid cases also showed high education levels whereas some of the lowest education levels also showed the lowest Covid-19 Cases. The district with the highest covid-19 cases also showed the highest education level.

This map was created using the graduated symbols tool. The population and case data was collected as described above. 

*Analysis of Population related to Covid-19 Cases per District*

A final analysis was conducted to see if there was a relationship between population and cases per district. In some districts there was a relationship between low population and low cases however the same was not for high population and high cases. Most of the cases are seen in moderate population districts. Many of the districts with the highest population showed some of the lowest cases.

Analysis for these maps were conducted using elevation and administrative boarder data 
from DIVA and pakistan census data. The census data was inserted into an excel sheet and 
combined with the administrative boarder shapefile. A centriod for each sub-district was 
found and used for analysis.
